## Contributing

### Environment

You will need:

* Android Studio
	* You can use [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) to get this
* High-end development box
	* You should ideally have MORE than 16GB of RAM
	* Ensure you have 50GB or so of free storage

On macOS, you will also need:

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) if developing for iOS
	* **Highly recommended to use [Xcodes](https://www.xcodes.app/)**
> [!WARNING]
> If you want to work on the **iOS version**, note that you strictly need an **Apple silicon** for development.  
> Unfortunately, JetBrains Compose Multiplatform **no longer compiles** on **Intel (x86_64) hosts** since
> the 1.11.1 version, even though Kotlin Native itself still supports them (although it's deprecated).
* Even more storage and compute. Kotlin Native is very heavy and slow.
	* Because of this, you are recommended to test mainly on Android, and only iOS for iOS specific
	  changes
